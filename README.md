***
#### Make
***
If there are already compiled files in the `src` directory, first run:

```bash
make clean
```

Then, to build the program, run:

```bash
make compile
```

This will create executable files: `part_one`, `part_two`, and `part_three`

***
#### Run
***
There are three executables in the program that can be run using their respective bash scripts.

Assignment 1 (parameters: multicast_group_address, port_number, group_size):
```bash
part_one.sh 224.0.0.1 3000 5
```

Assignment 2 ():
```bash
part_two.sh
```

Assignment 3 ():
```bash
part_three.sh
```

The logs from the program will be shown in the terminal with the required outputs for each assignment.
